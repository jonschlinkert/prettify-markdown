# prettify-markdown [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/prettify-markdown.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/prettify-markdown)

> Prettify, format or beautify your markdown. Whatever you want to call it, this does that. Used on hundreds of projects by verb.

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i prettify-markdown --save
```

Currently this does very basic, naive formatting focusing on headings and whitespace control. 

This was just externalized from [verb], where this case was used on hundreds of projects to format API documentation. As basic as it is, this has gotten the job done pretty consistently.

## Usage

```js
var prettify = require('prettify-markdown');

// pass a string of markdown
var result = prettify(str);
```
